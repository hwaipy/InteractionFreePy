"Here, `tcp://interactionfree.cn:1061` is the address of the broker. It is"
" provided by the InteractionFreePy project for testing. Due to the "
"limitations of the server, visiting our public broker may be slow. You "
"can also host your own broker to ensure the performance, latency time, "
"and privacy of your service. See [Hosting a broker](host_a_broker) for "
"more details. `'DragonCipher_Alice'` is the name of the service, which "
"can be any string that you want. `DragonCipher()` provided the instance "
"of the service. Finally, `IFLoop.join()` prevents the main thread from "
"exiting, keeping the service running."
msgstr ""
"这里，`tcp://interactionfree.cn:1061` 是我们提供的公共中心服务器 (broker) 的地址。"
"由于服务器限制，访问我们的公共中心服务器可能会比较慢。"
"你也可以运行自己的中心服务器，以确保服务的性能、延迟时间和隐私保护 (详情可参阅[自建中心服务器](host_a_broker))。"
"`'DragonCipher_Alice'` 是服务的名称，它可以是任何字符串。"
"`DragonCipher()`则是服务的具体实现。"
"最后，`IFLoop.join()` 是一个工具函数，阻止当前线程退出，从而保持服务持续运行。"

"As a client, he does not need to provide the service address or the "
"instance of the service. With the broker address provided, he can list "
"all the services available by calling `listServiceNames()`. Then, he can "
"call the service directly by using the service name as an attribute of "
"the worker instance, "
"`worker.DragonCipher_Alice.encrypt_to_dragon_speech(human_speech)`. The "
"most interesting part is that Bob can run the code on a completely "
"different machine and never needs to know the implementation details of "
"the service. He does not even need to import anything related to Alice. "
"With this code running, he might get the output like this:"
msgstr ""
"作为客户端，他不需要知道服务的地址或具体实现。只需提中心服务器地址，他就可以通过调用 `listServiceNames()` 来列出所有可用的服务。"
"然后，他可以直接将服务名作为 `worker` 实例的一个属性来调用该服务，例如 `worker.DragonCipher_Alice.encrypt_to_dragon_speech(human_speech)`。"
"最有趣的部分在于，Bob 可以在一个完全不同的机器上运行此代码，并且完全不需要知道服务的实现细节。"
"他甚至不需要导入任何与 Alice 服务相关的代码。运行此代码后，他可能会得到如下输出："

#: ../../source/quickstart.md:88
msgid ""
"The result of `listServiceNames()` may be different from the one shown "
"above.  It is the list of all the services that are currently running on "
"the broker. More importantly, as the service name is expected to be "
"unique, you might get an error if you try to run the service with the "
"same name as the one already running on the broker. Therefore, when using"
" my public testing broker located at `interactionfree.cn:1061`, it is "
"recommended to use a unique name for your service, such as your GitHub "
"username or any other unique identifier. For example, as my GitHub "
"username is `hwaipy`, I can use `DragonCipher_hwaipy` as the service "
"name."
msgstr ""
"`listServiceNames()` 返回的结果可能会跟上面显示的不同。"
"它是当前在该中心服务器上运行的所有服务的列表。"
"另外，由于服务名要求是唯一的，如果你尝试使用与中心服务器上已运行服务同名的名称来发布服务，则可能会收到错误。"
"因此，在使用我们的公共中心服务器 `interactionfree.cn:1061` 做测试时，建议为你的服务使用一个唯一的名称，例如添加您的 GitHub 用户名或其他唯一标识符。"
"比如，我的 GitHub 用户名为 `hwaipy`，那么我就可以使用 `DragonCipher_hwaipy` 作为服务名。"
